<h1>Card Rulings</h1>

<p><b>The following rulings are pulled from the PokeGym Compendium, as well as from various references to reprints.</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Special Conditions</li>
    <ul class = "subset">
        <li>Confusion</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If my confused Pokemon tries to use a GX attack and flips Tails, does that use up my "one GX attack per game"?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, if you flip tails the attack fails and you don't use up your GX attack.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Sun and Moon (SM)</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Tsareena</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>When you use Tsareena's "Queenly Majesty" ABility, when the opponent reveals their hand do you get to choose which card
                to discard or is it random>?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You get to choose.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Can I use Tsareena's "Queenly Majesty" Ability and not discard anything from my opponent's hand?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, because the card says "you may look at your opponent's hand and discard 1 card you find there", you must discard a card.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Gumshoos-GX</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If I have multiple Gumshoos-GX in play, can I use each of their "Search the Premises" Abilities or am I limited to only one total per turn?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Each Gumshoos-GX can use its own ability once per turn. So if you have two of them you can use the first Search the Premises to have your opponent reveal their hand,
                    then use a Trainer card such as N to have the opponent shuffle their hand into their deck and draw new cards, and then use the second Search the Premises to have your
                    opponent reveal their hand again.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Umbreon-GX</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can Umbreon-GX's Dark Call attack discard 2 Double Colorless Energy?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, it can discard 2 of any type of energy.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Dragonair</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>On the turn after using Dragonair's "Dragon Wish" attack, when I attack any number of Energy cards from my hand do I have to attach them all at once, or can I attach
                them whenever I want during my turn?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You do not have to attach them all at once. You can attach them from your hand whenever you like during the duration of your turn following Dragon's Wish..</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If I use Dragonair's "Dragon's Wish" attack and then on the following turn evolve it to Dragonite, can I still attach the energies or not??</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, absolutely! The Dragon's Wish effect resides on the player, not on the Pokemon.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Rotom Dex</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>What if I use Town Map, then Rotom Dex?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You would shuffle your face-up prize cards into your deck, and deal equally that many face-down cards into your prizes.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>EXP Share</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>What if I forget to move a Basic Energy from my KOed Active Pokemon to a benched Pokemon with an EXP Share attached?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Once the Active Pokemon reaches the discard pile, the effects of EXP Share are ignored, so you may not continue to attach the
                    Basic Energy.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Professor Kukui</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I play Professor Kukui if I have no cards left in my deck?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes you can, because you still get to do the +20 bonus damage for your Pokemon's attacks.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Nest Ball</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I use Nest Ball if my Bench is full?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Of course not, don't be foolish. (adapted from Great Ball ruling Oct 28, 2004)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <li>XY Evolutions (EVO)</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Starmie</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I use Starmie's "Space Beacon" Ability to discard a card from my hand if there are no Basic Energies in my discard pile?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes you can. The first part of Space Beacon is to discard a card fro your hand, period. Then you do as much of the rest of the Ability as you are able to.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Clefairy</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I have Clefairy's "Metronome" copy a GX attack, and if so does it use up my "one GX attack per game"?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes you can, and yes it does. Also if you've already used your GX attack for the game, then you cannot choose a GX attack with Metronome.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <li>XY Promos (XYP)</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Darkrai</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If Darkrai attacks with "Abyssal Sleep", can Pokemon Ranger clear the effect of flipping 2 coins when asleep?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Asleep, Poisoned, etc. are Special Conditions, regardless of how many coinf you flip or how much damage the poison condition does. Therefore they are not altered by Pokemn Ranger.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <li>XY Steam Siege (STM)</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Volcanion-EX</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If I use Volcanion-EX's Volcanic Heat attack, but I already used it the turn before, does my turn immediately end?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Once you've declared an attack, you cannot leave the attack step without your opponent's permission. If you declare an
                "illegal" attack, you may ask your opponent's permission to back out of the attack step. If he or she says "yes", you can
                go back and take any actions that you could have taken prior to the attack step. If he or she says "no", you may either
                select an attack that is legal or you may pass.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Does Parallel City reduce Volcanion-EX's attack by 40, since Volcanion-EX is Fire and Water typed?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, it only reduces by 20, because you can only use an effect of a card once per Pokemon if it's eligible.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Magearna-EX</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If Magearna-EX with the "Mystic Heart" Ability is in play, are all Pokemon with Metal Energy attached protected from Greninja's Shadow Stitching attack?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>If Magearna-EX has a Metal Energy attached to it, all Pokemon with Metal Energy attached are protected; however, if Magearna-EX does not have a Metal Energy
                    attached to it, its Mystic Heart Ability is shut off and no Pokemon with Metal Energy attached are protected.</li>

        <li>Pokemon Ranger</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If Darkrai attacks with "Abyssal Sleep", can Pokemon Ranger clear the effect of flipping 2 coins when asleep?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Asleep, Poisoned, etc. are Special Conditions, regardless of how many coinf you flip or how much damage the poison condition does. Therefore they are not altered by Pokemn Ranger.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Captivating Pokepuff</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If I have a Team Magma's Secret Base in play and I play a Captivating Pokepuff, are the Pokemon I force into play affected by Team Magma's Secret Base?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, Team Magma's Secret Base reads that Pokeon played take damage when played from your hand, which they are in this case.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <li>XY Fates Collide (FCO)</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Marowak</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If I used Volcanion-EX's "Volcanic Heat" attack last turn, then on this turn I play Marowak and use its "Bodyguard" ability that says to "remove any existing
            effects", does that mean I can use Volcanion-EX's "Volcanic Heat" attack on this turn?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Sorry, but no. You can only remove effects that were done by your opponent's Pokemon, not effects done by your own Pokemon.</li>

        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I return a Splash Energy to my hand to add 20 damage to Greninja's Moonlight Slash attack?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, Splash Energy is considered a Basic Water Energy when attached to a Pokemon.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If Magearna-EX with the "Mystic Heart" Ability is in play, are all Pokemon with Metal Energy attached protected from Greninja's Shadow Stitching attack?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>If Magearna-EX has a Metal Energy attached to it, all Pokemon with Metal Energy attached are protected; however, if Magearna-EX does not have a Metal Energy

            <li>If my Yveltal with "Fright Night" Ability gets KO'd, am I then able to use EXP Share on one of my Benched Pokemon to recover one of Yveltal's Basic Energy cards?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Sorry, but no. Fright Night would still be working, so EXP Share would not enable before Yveltal hits the discard pile.</li>

            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, you can only heal 30 per turn, because you can only use an effect of a card once per Pokemon if it's eligible.</li>
