<h1>Card Rulings</h1>

<p><b>The following rulings are pulled from the PokeGym Compendium, as well as from various references to reprints.</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Special Conditions</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Confusion</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If my confused Pokemon tries to use a GX attack and flips Tails, does that use up my "one GX attack per game"?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, if you flip tails the attack fails and you don't use up your GX attack.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <li>Ancient Traits</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Alpha Growth</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>The "Alpha Growth" Ancient Trait says "When you attach an Energy card from your hand to this Pokemon... you may attach 2 Energy cards." Does that mean I get to attach one additional Energy card or two additional Energy cards?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You only get to attach one additional Energy card, for a total of two cards attached at that time. (Primal Clash FAQ; Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Delta Evolution</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I use Rare Candy to evolve a Basic Pokemon into a Stage 2 Pokemon with the "Delta Evolution" Ancient Trait on my first turn or on the Basic Pokemon's first turn in play?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, you may not. (Roaring Skies FAQ; May 7, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Omega Barrage</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If I attack using a Pokemon that has the "Omega Barrage" Ancient Trait, can I do things like attach an Energy or play a Trainer between attacks?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, you would resolve all effects from the first attack and then either perform your second attack or pass. You don't get to go back into the main part of your turn again. (Primal Clash FAQ; Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If I only have one energy card attached to Excadrill, can I use its "Omega Barrage" to attack with "Dredge" first to attach two energy cards, then attack a second time with "Mach Claw"?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, that would work. (Primal Clash FAQ; Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>What happens for Omega Barrage if the Pokemon is Confused?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You need to flip for Confusion twice if you choose to attack twice. One flip for the first attack, then flip again if you decide to attack again. (Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Omega Barrier</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I attach a Team Flare "Pokemon Tool F" card to my opponent's Pokemon-EX if it has the "Omega Barrier" Ancient Trait?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, you can. The text of Omega Barrier says its effect excludes Pokemon Tools and Stadium cards. (Primal Clash FAQ; Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If I use Escape Rope but my opponent's Active Pokemon has the "Omega Barrier" Ancient Trait does he or she have to switch it? Or if they have a Pokemon with "Omega Barrier" on the bench can he or she choose that and not switch it to Active?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>If your opponent has an Active Pokemon with "Omega Barrier", then Escape Rope's effect will be blocked. If a Pokemon with "Omega Barrier" is on the bench, choosing that Pokemon will not stop the effect as the Active was the target of Escape Rope. (Primal Clash FAQ; Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If my opponent's Active Pokemon has the "Omega Barrier" Ancient Trait, can I use Lysandre to switch one of my benched Pokemon with it?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>If your opponent's Benched Pokemon has "Omega Barrier", then Lysandre's effect will be blocked. But choosing a Benched Pokemon without "Omega Barrier" will cause it to switch with the Active Pokemon because the Benched Pokemon is the target of Lysandre. (Apr 9, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Theta Stop</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I evolve into Mega Sceptile-EX if I have a Sceptile Spirit Link attached without ending my turn if my opponent has Yveltal BKT in the Active?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, because the Mega Evolution rule activates Mega Sceptile-EX is already in play, Theta Stop overrides Yveltal's Fright Night ability.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If a Pokemon with an Ability also has the "Theta Stop" Ancient Trait, would it prevent Wobbuffet's "Bide Barricade" from stopping that Ability?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes it would because Bide Barricade is an effect that is targeting the Pokemon, so Theta Stop would prevent Bide Barricade from blocking the Pokemon's Ability. (Sep 3, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If I use Absol's "Cursed Eyes" Ability to move three damage counters from one of my opponent's Pokemon to another, what happens if I choose a Pokemon with the "Theta Stop" Ancient Trait?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Since Theta Stop prevents all effects of Abilities done by your Pokemon, if you choose to move the damage counters to a Pokemon with Theta Stop the damage counters would be discarded rather than moved onto that Pokemon. However, if you choose a Pokemon with Theta Stop as the source of where the damage counters would be moved from, they simply are not moved and the Cursed Eyes ability stops there. (Sep 3, 2015 TPCi Rules Team; Sep 24, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <li>Sun and Moon (SM)</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Tsareena</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>When you use Tsareena's "Queenly Majesty" ABility, when the opponent reveals their hand do you get to choose which card
                to discard or is it random>?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You get to choose.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Can I use Tsareena's "Queenly Majesty" Ability and not discard anything from my opponent's hand?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, because the card says "you may look at your opponent's hand and discard 1 card you find there", you must discard a card.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Eevee</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>For Eevee, can you attach an energy and use its "Energy Evolution" ability and evolve on your first turn? How about on Eevee's first turn in play?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes. You can evolve on your first turn and also on the turn that you played Eevee via this Ability. (Furious Fists FAQ; Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Will Eevee's "Energy Evolution" ability still trigger if it has an Energy attached to it while it's affected by a Special Condition?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>There is no text on the card to say it's shut off, so it still works even when afflicted by a Special Condition. (Furious Fists FAQ; Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If I attach a Rainbow Energy to Eevee, what Energy type does it count as for "Energy Evolution"?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Rainbow Energy is not a Basic Energy card. It will not trigger the Ability. (Furious Fists FAQ; Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>What happens if I attach a Fighting Energy type to Eevee?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You still get to search your deck even though you would not be able to find a suitable evolution card. (Furious Fists FAQ; Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Say I attach a Water Energy to Eevee and do "Energy Evolution". I want to find a Glaceon but unfortunately I only have a Vaporeon in my deck. Do I have to attach the Vaporeon to Eevee?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No. Any search for a specific card or type of card in your deck can be "failed" at your option. (Furious Fists FAQ; Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If I attach a Basic Energy to Eevee and trigger its "Energy Evolution" ability but choose an evolution belonging to Team Plasma, would I take the damage from Frozen City stadium or not?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>The mandatory effect of the Frozen City stadium comes before the optional effect of Energy Evolution. If the Eevee is not a Team Plasma Pokemon before choosing whether to use Energy Evolution, you would take the damage from Frozen City. (Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If Eevee only has 10hp left and Frozen City is in play, would it be KO'd before I have a chance to use its "Energy Evolution" ability by attaching a Basic Energy?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, it would not. All triggered effects have to be resolved before checking for KO's, so you would take the +10 damage for Frozen City first, then use Energy Evolution to search your deck. Of course, if you fail the search and Eevee's damage is greater than or equal to its HP, then Eevee is KO'd. (Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Gumshoos-GX</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If I have multiple Gumshoos-GX in play, can I use each of their "Search the Premises" Abilities or am I limited to only one total per turn?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Each Gumshoos-GX can use its own ability once per turn. So if you have two of them you can use the first Search the Premises to have your opponent reveal their hand,
                    then use a Trainer card such as N to have the opponent shuffle their hand into their deck and draw new cards, and then use the second Search the Premises to have your
                    opponent reveal their hand again.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Oranguru</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Say a player calls Oranguru's Instruct Ability, but then realizes they already have six or more cards in their hand. Does that mean his Instruct Ability is used up, or can he use it later in the turn since nothing happened?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>[Instruct] says "you may draw cards until you have [3] cards in your hand"; if you have too many cards you cannot "draw zero" so the [Ability Instruct] is not used up. (Jan 12, 2012 TPCi Rules Team, adapted from Magnetic Draw ruling)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Umbreon-GX</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can Umbreon-GX's Dark Call attack discard 2 Double Colorless Energy?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, it can discard 2 of any type of energy.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Dragonair</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>On the turn after using Dragonair's "Dragon Wish" attack, when I attack any number of Energy cards from my hand do I have to attach them all at once, or can I attach
                them whenever I want during my turn?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You do not have to attach them all at once. You can attach them from your hand whenever you like during the duration of your turn following Dragon's Wish..</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If I use Dragonair's "Dragon's Wish" attack and then on the following turn evolve it to Dragonite, can I still attach the energies or not??</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, absolutely! The Dragon's Wish effect resides on the player, not on the Pokemon.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Rotom Dex</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>What if I use Town Map, then Rotom Dex?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You would shuffle your face-up prize cards into your deck, and deal equally that many face-down cards into your prizes.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>EXP Share</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>What if I forget to move a Basic Energy from my KOed Active Pokemon to a benched Pokemon with an EXP Share attached?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Once the Active Pokemon reaches the discard pile, the effects of EXP Share are ignored, so you may not continue to attach the
                    Basic Energy.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Professor Kukui</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I play Professor Kukui if I have no cards left in my deck?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes you can, because you still get to do the +20 bonus damage for your Pokemon's attacks.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Nest Ball</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I use Nest Ball if my Bench is full?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Of course not, don't be foolish. (adapted from Great Ball ruling Oct 28, 2004, adapted from Great Ball ruling)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <li>XY Promos (XYP)</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Darkrai</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If Darkrai attacks with "Abyssal Sleep", can Pokemon Ranger clear the effect of flipping 2 coins when asleep?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Asleep, Poisoned, etc. are Special Conditions, regardless of how many coinf you flip or how much damage the poison condition does. Therefore they are not altered by Pokemn Ranger.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Mew-EX</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>For Mew EX's "Versatile" Ability, do I need to have the same energy types as the attack I'm copying, or will any type of energy work as long as I have the correct number of energies?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You must meet the energy requirements as to both type and number for the attack Mew EX is copying. So if the attack requires two Water energy, you will need to have at least two Water energy attached to Mew EX. (Feb 16, 2006 PUI Rules Team; BW:Dragons Exalted FAQ; Aug 23, 2012 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Since a BREAK Pokemon "retains the attacks, Abilities, Weakness, Resistance, and Retreat Cost of its previous Evolution" can a Mew EX with the "Versatile" Ability use an attack of the Pokemon that the BREAK Pokemon evolved from (providing it meets energy requirements, etc.)?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, it can. The underlying Pokemon's attacks are part of the BREAK Evolved Pokemon and are therefore able to be copied by Versatile. (Dec 3, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If my Wailord uses "Giant Wave" this turn, can my opponent's Mew EX's "Versatile" Ability use that attack on the turn following mine?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes. The effect of "this Pokemon can't use Giant Wave next turn" applies only to the Pokemon that attacked with it. (Dragons Exalted FAQ; Aug 23, 2012 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>What happens if Mew EX uses its "Versatile" ability to copy Xerneas EX's "X Blast" attack? Can it use "X Blast" again the following turn or not?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>When Mew EX attacks, Versatile uses the attack name specified. So when it attacks with X Blast, Mew EX cannot use that attack twice in a row. (Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <li>XY Evolutions (EVO)</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Starmie</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I use Starmie's "Space Beacon" Ability to discard a card from my hand if there are no Basic Energies in my discard pile?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes you can. The first part of Space Beacon is to discard a card fro your hand, period. Then you do as much of the rest of the Ability as you are able to.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Clefairy</li>
        <ul class = "subset">

            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, you can only heal 30 per turn, because you can only use an effect of a card once per Pokemon if it's eligible.</li>

            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Once the Active Pokemon reaches the discard pile, the effects of EXP Share are ignored, so you may not continue to attach the

            <li>For Mew EX's "Versatile" Ability, do I need to have the same energy types as the attack I'm copying, or will any type of energy work as long as I have the correct number of energies?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You must meet the energy requirements as to both type and number for the attack Mew EX is copying. So if the attack requires two Water energy, you will need to have at least two Water energy attached to Mew EX.

            <li>Since a BREAK Pokemon "retains the attacks, Abilities, Weakness, Resistance, and Retreat Cost of its previous Evolution" can a Mew EX with the "Versatile" Ability use an attack of the Pokemon that the BREAK Pokemon evolved from (providing it meets energy requirements, etc.)?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, it can. The underlying Pokemon's attacks are part of the BREAK Evolved Pokemon and are therefore able to be copied by Versatile. (Dec 3, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If my Wailord uses "Giant Wave" this turn, can my opponent's Mew EX's "Versatile" Ability use that attack on the turn following mine?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes. The effect of "this Pokemon can't use Giant Wave next turn" applies only to the Pokemon that attacked with it. (Dragons Exalted FAQ; Aug 23, 2012 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>What happens if Mew EX uses its "Versatile" ability to copy Xerneas EX's "X Blast" attack? Can it use "X Blast" again the following turn or not?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>When Mew EX attacks, Versatile uses the attack name specified. So when it attacks with X Blast, Mew EX cannot use that attack twice in a row. (Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
