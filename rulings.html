<ul>
    <li>Special Conditions</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Confusion</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If my confused Pokemon tries to use a GX attack and flips Tails, does that use up my "one GX attack per game"?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, if you flip tails the attack fails and you don't use up your GX attack.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

    <li>Ancient Traits</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Alpha Growth</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>The "Alpha Growth" Ancient Trait says "When you attach an Energy card from your hand to this Pokemon... you may attach 2 Energy cards." Does that mean I get to attach one additional Energy card or two additional Energy cards?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You only get to attach one additional Energy card, for a total of two cards attached at that time. (Primal Clash FAQ; Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Delta Evolution</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I use Rare Candy to evolve a Basic Pokemon into a Stage 2 Pokemon with the "Delta Evolution" Ancient Trait on my first turn or on the Basic Pokemon's first turn in play?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, you may not. (Roaring Skies FAQ; May 7, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Omega Barrage</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If I attack using a Pokemon that has the "Omega Barrage" Ancient Trait, can I do things like attach an Energy or play a Trainer between attacks?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, you would resolve all effects from the first attack and then either perform your second attack or pass. You don't get to go back into the main part of your turn again. (Primal Clash FAQ; Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If I only have one energy card attached to Excadrill, can I use its "Omega Barrage" to attack with "Dredge" first to attach two energy cards, then attack a second time with "Mach Claw"?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, that would work. (Primal Clash FAQ; Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>What happens for Omega Barrage if the Pokemon is Confused?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You need to flip for Confusion twice if you choose to attack twice. One flip for the first attack, then flip again if you decide to attack again. (Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Omega Barrier</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I attach a Team Flare "Pokemon Tool F" card to my opponent's Pokemon-EX if it has the "Omega Barrier" Ancient Trait?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, you can. The text of Omega Barrier says its effect excludes Pokemon Tools and Stadium cards. (Primal Clash FAQ; Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If I use Escape Rope but my opponent's Active Pokemon has the "Omega Barrier" Ancient Trait does he or she have to switch it? Or if they have a Pokemon with "Omega Barrier" on the bench can he or she choose that and not switch it to Active?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>If your opponent has an Active Pokemon with "Omega Barrier", then Escape Rope's effect will be blocked. If a Pokemon with "Omega Barrier" is on the bench, choosing that Pokemon will not stop the effect as the Active was the target of Escape Rope. (Primal Clash FAQ; Feb 5, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If my opponent's Active Pokemon has the "Omega Barrier" Ancient Trait, can I use Lysandre to switch one of my benched Pokemon with it?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>If your opponent's Benched Pokemon has "Omega Barrier", then Lysandre's effect will be blocked. But choosing a Benched Pokemon without "Omega Barrier" will cause it to switch with the Active Pokemon because the Benched Pokemon is the target of Lysandre. (Apr 9, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Theta Stop</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I evolve into Mega Sceptile-EX if I have a Sceptile Spirit Link attached without ending my turn if my opponent has Yveltal BKT in the Active?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, because the Mega Evolution rule activates Mega Sceptile-EX is already in play, Theta Stop overrides Yveltal's Fright Night ability.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If a Pokemon with an Ability also has the "Theta Stop" Ancient Trait, would it prevent Wobbuffet's "Bide Barricade" from stopping that Ability?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes it would because Bide Barricade is an effect that is targeting the Pokemon, so Theta Stop would prevent Bide Barricade from blocking the Pokemon's Ability. (Sep 3, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If I use Absol's "Cursed Eyes" Ability to move three damage counters from one of my opponent's Pokemon to another, what happens if I choose a Pokemon with the "Theta Stop" Ancient Trait?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Since Theta Stop prevents all effects of Abilities done by your Pokemon, if you choose to move the damage counters to a Pokemon with Theta Stop the damage counters would be discarded rather than moved onto that Pokemon. However, if you choose a Pokemon with Theta Stop as the source of where the damage counters would be moved from, they simply are not moved and the Cursed Eyes ability stops there. (Sep 3, 2015 TPCi Rules Team; Sep 24, 2015 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <li>Sun and Moon (SM)</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Tsareena</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>When you use Tsareena's "Queenly Majesty" ABility, when the opponent reveals their hand do you get to choose which card
                to discard or is it random>?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You get to choose.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Can I use Tsareena's "Queenly Majesty" Ability and not discard anything from my opponent's hand?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, because the card says "you may look at your opponent's hand and discard 1 card you find there", you must discard a card.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Eevee</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>For Eevee, can you attach an energy and use its "Energy Evolution" ability and evolve on your first turn? How about on Eevee's first turn in play?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes. You can evolve on your first turn and also on the turn that you played Eevee via this Ability. (Furious Fists FAQ; Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Will Eevee's "Energy Evolution" ability still trigger if it has an Energy attached to it while it's affected by a Special Condition?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>There is no text on the card to say it's shut off, so it still works even when afflicted by a Special Condition. (Furious Fists FAQ; Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If I attach a Rainbow Energy to Eevee, what Energy type does it count as for "Energy Evolution"?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Rainbow Energy is not a Basic Energy card. It will not trigger the Ability. (Furious Fists FAQ; Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>What happens if I attach a Fighting Energy type to Eevee?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You still get to search your deck even though you would not be able to find a suitable evolution card. (Furious Fists FAQ; Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Say I attach a Water Energy to Eevee and do "Energy Evolution". I want to find a Glaceon but unfortunately I only have a Vaporeon in my deck. Do I have to attach the Vaporeon to Eevee?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No. Any search for a specific card or type of card in your deck can be "failed" at your option. (Furious Fists FAQ; Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If I attach a Basic Energy to Eevee and trigger its "Energy Evolution" ability but choose an evolution belonging to Team Plasma, would I take the damage from Frozen City stadium or not?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>The mandatory effect of the Frozen City stadium comes before the optional effect of Energy Evolution. If the Eevee is not a Team Plasma Pokemon before choosing whether to use Energy Evolution, you would take the damage from Frozen City. (Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If Eevee only has 10hp left and Frozen City is in play, would it be KO'd before I have a chance to use its "Energy Evolution" ability by attaching a Basic Energy?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No, it would not. All triggered effects have to be resolved before checking for KO's, so you would take the +10 damage for Frozen City first, then use Energy Evolution to search your deck. Of course, if you fail the search and Eevee's damage is greater than or equal to its HP, then Eevee is KO'd. (Aug 28, 2014 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Gumshoos-GX</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If I have multiple Gumshoos-GX in play, can I use each of their "Search the Premises" Abilities or am I limited to only one total per turn?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Each Gumshoos-GX can use its own ability once per turn. So if you have two of them you can use the first Search the Premises to have your opponent reveal their hand,
                    then use a Trainer card such as N to have the opponent shuffle their hand into their deck and draw new cards, and then use the second Search the Premises to have your
                    opponent reveal their hand again.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Oranguru</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Say a player calls Oranguru's Instruct Ability, but then realizes they already have six or more cards in their hand. Does that mean his Instruct Ability is used up, or can he use it later in the turn since nothing happened?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>[Instruct] says "you may draw cards until you have [3] cards in your hand"; if you have too many cards you cannot "draw zero" so the [Ability Instruct] is not used up. (Jan 12, 2012 TPCi Rules Team, adapted from Magnetic Draw ruling)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Umbreon-GX</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can Umbreon-GX's Dark Call attack discard 2 Double Colorless Energy?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, it can discard 2 of any type of energy.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Solgaleo-GX</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I attach Special Energies by using Solgaleo-GX's Sol Burst Attack?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, you may attach Special Energies using Sol Burst.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Can I use Eevee's Energy Evolution Ability to evolve from using Sol Burst></li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No. Energy Evolution states you can evolve if you attach from hand, and Sol Burst attaches Energy from your deck.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Dragonair</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>On the turn after using Dragonair's "Dragon Wish" attack, when I attack any number of Energy cards from my hand do I have to attach them all at once, or can I attach
                them whenever I want during my turn?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You do not have to attach them all at once. You can attach them from your hand whenever you like during the duration of your turn following Dragon's Wish.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If I use Dragonair's "Dragon's Wish" attack and then on the following turn evolve it to Dragonite, can I still attach the energies or not??</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes, absolutely! The Dragon's Wish effect resides on the player, not on the Pokemon.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Professor Kukui</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I play Professor Kukui if I have no cards left in my deck?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Yes you can, because you still get to do the +20 bonus damage for your Pokemon's attacks.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Rotom Dex</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>What if I use Town Map, then Rotom Dex?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You would shuffle your face-up prize cards into your deck, and deal equally that many face-down cards into your prizes.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>EXP Share</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>What if I forget to move a Basic Energy from my KOed Active Pokemon to a benched Pokemon with an EXP Share attached?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Once the Active Pokemon reaches the discard pile, the effects of EXP Share are ignored, so you may not continue to attach the
                    Basic Energy.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>If my Yveltal with "Fright Night" Ability gets KO'd, am I then able to use EXP Share on one of my Benched Pokemon to recover one of Yveltal's Basic Energy cards?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Sorry, but no. Fright Night would still be working, so EXP Share would not enable before Yveltal hits the discard pile.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Poison Barb</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If Resistance causes me to hit for 0 damage on a Pokemon with Poison Barb attached, would I still get Poisoned?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Poison Barb only activates when the opponent's Pokemon is "damaged by an attack", so in this case it would not activate.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Nest Ball</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Can I use Nest Ball if my Bench is full?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Of course not, don't be foolish. (adapted from Great Ball ruling Oct 28, 2004)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Can I use Nest Ball Shaymin-EX and use the Set Up Ability to draw cards?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>No. Shaymin-EX states you must play it from your hand in order to use Set Up. The same goes for Hoopa-EX and Scoundrel Ring.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <li>XY Promos (XYP)</li>
    <ul class = "set">
        <li>Darkrai</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>If Darkrai attacks with "Abyssal Sleep", can Pokemon Ranger clear the effect of flipping 2 coins when asleep?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>Asleep, Poisoned, etc. are Special Conditions, regardless of how many coinf you flip or how much damage the poison condition does. Therefore they are not altered by Pokemn Ranger.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <li>Mew-EX</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>For Mew EX's "Versatile" Ability, do I need to have the same energy types as the attack I'm copying, or will any type of energy work as long as I have the correct number of energies?</li>
            <ul class = "rule">
                <li>You must meet the energy requirements as to both type and number for the attack Mew EX is copying. So if the attack requires two Water energy, you will need to have at least two Water energy attached to Mew EX. (Feb 16, 2006 PUI Rules Team; BW:Dragons Exalted FAQ; Aug 23, 2012 TPCi Rules Team)</li>
            </ul>

        <li>Minor</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>These errors have very little effect on game-play and can usually be fixed with little effort. In many cases, players should be given multiple starting penalties before escalating the penalty, and the maximum penalty given should be a Prize Card penalty. Examples of Game-Play Error: Minor include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Drawing a card to your hand without showing it to your opponent when the card tells
                    you to do so. </li>
                <li>Declaring an attack without having the proper Energy attached.</li>
                <li>Failing to place Prize cards at the beginning of the game. Discovered after play starts but
                    before any searches of the deck.</li>
                <li>Forgetting to discard a Supporter card after it has been played.</li>
                <li>Drawing an extra card.</li>
                <li>Forgetting to flip a coin for a Burned or Poisoned Pokémon between turns</li>
                <li>Inadvertently revealing the top card of your deck, or one of your Prize cards.</li>

        <li>Major</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>When game state has become irreversibly confused due to game-play errors, it is appropriate
                for the judge to issue a higher-level penalty. Major game-play error penalties are also
                appropriate for minor game-play errors that have left the game too confused to reset. In addition to the assigned penalty to the offending player, a Caution should be issued to the
                player’s opponent for not properly keeping track of game state and rules. Examples of Game-Play Error:
                Major include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing more than one Energy card in a single turn without the use of an effect that

            <li>**If two searches have been made, the starting penalty can be escalated one step. If three or
                more searches have been made, escalating to the next penalty tier is appropriate.</li>

        <li>Severe</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>In some cases, a game-play error occurs which irreparably breaks the game state. In these cases,
                there is no way that either player or a judge can reset the game to the point where it can be
                continued.
                In addition to the assigned penalty to the offending player, a Warning should be issued to the
                player’s opponent for not properly keeping track of game state and rules.

                escalating to the next penalty tier is appropriate.
                Placing the deck in card sleeves (if unsleeved) or replacing the damaged sleeves (if sleeved)
                usually solves the problem. Marked cards or sleeves should be replaced as soon as possible,
                without disrupting game play. Examples of Marked Cards: Minor include:</li>

                    along the lower edge of the sleeve. The combination of cards does not create a pattern

                <li>The player’s sleeves have standard wear and tear in different areas of the sleeves, which

            <li>This penalty applies to a player who has marked cards or sleeves where there is a discernable
                pattern to which cards are marked. Because the possibility for a player to gain an advantage is
                high, the penalties associated with this category are more severe. Further investigation may be
                required to determine if the markings are intentional, or if the player is using accidental
                markings to intentionally gain advantage. If either of these proves to be the case, the penalty
                should be escalated to Unsporting Conduct: Cheating, and the appropriate action should be
                taken.

            <ul>

            <li>If a player’s decklist meets the format restrictions and deck construction rules but the deck does
                not, the illegal cards must be removed from the deck, and the deck must be modified to match
                the decklist. The Head Judge should carefully consider what advantage, if any, was gained by the
                illegal deck. If the Head Judge feels that there was a significant advantage, escalating the penalty
                may be necessary.
                The exception to this is if cards are simply missing from the deck. This usually happens if the
                player and a previous opponent are using similar sleeves, if cards get stuck in the player’s deck
                box, or if cards are dropped on the floor. If the card is found, or the player can provide an
                identical card to replace the missing one, the player should be allowed to continue the event
                without further modifying the deck or the decklist. If the card cannot be found and the player
                cannot provide an identical card, the missing card should be replaced with a basic Energy card of
                the player’s choice, and the decklist should be modified to reflect the new contents of the deck.

                    Ghetsis to his or her deck. If that player cannot provide one, he or she must add a basic

                    deck must be modified to match the decklist. If that player cannot provide the legal

                <li>The player’s deck contains foreign cards as defined by the Pokémon Tournament Rules.

        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Occasionally, a player will simply show up with an illegal decklist and deck that do not meet the
                format restrictions or the deck construction rules. When this is the case, both the deck and the
                decklist must be modified to make the deck legal for the event. Any illegal cards should be
                replaced with basic Energy cards of the player’s choice, and the changes should be reflected on
                the decklist.
                As with the previous category, the Head Judge should carefully consider what advantage, if any,
                was gained by the illegal deck. If the Head Judge feels that there was a significant advantage or
                the error cannot be easily fixed during the match, escalating the may be necessary.
                Examples of Deck Problems: Illegal Decklist, Illegal Deck include:</li>

        <li>Legal Decklist, Legal Deck</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Occasionally a player’s decklist and deck meet the format restrictions and the deck construction
                rules but do not match. As the contents of the decklist always take priority over the contents of
                the deck itself, the player must modify his or her deck so that it matches the decklist. If the
                player is unable to provide the cards listed on the decklist, missing cards should be replaced
                with basic Energy cards of the player’s choice, and the decklist should be updated to reflect
                these changes.

            below are general guidelines; players attempting to compartmentalize their turn in order to use every

            Unsporting Conduct: Severe penalties.

        <ul>
            <li>Performing the actions of a card or attack: 15 seconds</li>

        <li>Slow Play</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Players should take care to play in a manner that keeps the game pace lively, regardless of the
                complexity of the situation. A player who takes too long to make decisions about game play runs the
                risk of putting his or her opponent at a disadvantage due to the round’s time limit. In addition to the
                recommended penalty, the judge may issue a time extension to offset this disadvantage.
                Slow play penalties should escalate at a faster rate than other penalties, but should not exceed a
                Prize Card penalty.
                Examples of Game Tempo: Slow Play include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You are excessively slow when deciding which Pokémon to attach an Energy card to.</li>

        <li>Rushing</li>
        <ul class = "subset">
            <li>Rushing involves a player trying to get his or her opponent to play faster. This can cause the
                opponent to lose his or her concentration, making the player more likely to make a mistake. Rushing
                is often a symptom of an opponent’s Slow Play, but it can also occur when a player is excited to get
                to his or her next turn.
                Examples of Game Tempo: Rushing include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Placing/tapping your hand near your deck to draw a card during an opponent’s turn,
                    indicating that you are ready to start your turn.</li>
                <li>Making exasperated noises or comments regarding your opponent’s actions.</li>
